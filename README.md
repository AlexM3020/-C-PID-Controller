# C++ PID-Controller
Project for the course "Electronics and Data Acquisition", Unimore 2022

The purpose of the experiment is to regulate the temperature of a small oven using PID control. In our case, the analysis was carried out by adjusting the temperature using both On/Off and PID control, comparing them, and verifying that the latter is indeed the better solution for appropriate values of the constants.
